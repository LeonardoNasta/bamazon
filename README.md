# THE MUSIC STORE

The Bamazon Music Store is a simple command line app where you can buy, or atleast pretend to buy, some of your favorite songs!

It was created with node.js and uses inquierer.js to communicate with the user and a MYSQL database to make sure album stock is updated with each purchase.
